Based on the hop order and steps file, the sequence of steps is as follows:

1. Get files from result
2. Text file output

Now, let's convert these steps into Spark code:

Step 1: Get files from result
In Pentaho, this step is used to get the list of files from the previous result. In Spark, we can use the wholeTextFiles method to get the files from a directory.

```scala
val files = sc.wholeTextFiles("path_to_directory")
```

Step 2: Text file output
In Pentaho, this step is used to write the result into a text file. In Spark, we can use the saveAsTextFile method to save the result into a text file.

```scala
files.saveAsTextFile("${java.io.tmpdir}files")
```

Please replace "path_to_directory" with the actual directory path where the files are located. Also, "${java.io.tmpdir}files" is the output directory where the result will be saved. If you want to save the result in a different directory, please replace "${java.io.tmpdir}files" with your preferred directory path.
